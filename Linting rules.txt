VERY IMPORTANT READ IT CAREFULLY PLEASE.

Modular design
All modules are organized under the modules directory.
 The top level description can be found under topLevelCircuit.v. It contains a modular design of the processor and encompasses five pipe stages and four pipe registers,
 the description for which are present under modules/pipeStages and modules/pipeRegisters respectively. The register file, the hazard detection and the forwarding units are also instantiated in topLevelCircuit.v. Pipe stages are made of and encapsulate other supporting modules.

Constants
defines.v contains project-wide constants for opcodes,
 execution commands, and branch condition commands.
 It also contains constants for wire widths and memory specifications. You can change memory size values to suit your needs.

Wire naming convention
To maintain conformity, most wire names follow the format {wire description}_{wire stage},
where the second part describes the stage where the wire is located.
For example, MEM_W_EN_ID is the memory write enable signal present in the instruction decode stage.
